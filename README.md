# CSGO Zombie Escape Mod Server (Ready To Use)
A ready to go Zombie Escape Server base install you can copy to your Linux or Windows CS GO server.

This is made with the intent of helping a new server owner getting started with ZE. This will hopefully bring more interest to our community as a whole. The more players and people interested, the better it is for everyone!

Please remember that this is a BASE install that contains a few fixes. There will be other things that you need on your server. Most ZE servers end up with around 100+ plugins by the time they are "finished". This is to just get you started.
